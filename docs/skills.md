# Skills

Skills are one-command workflows. Type `/name` and the AI runs a full sequence of steps.

## Built-in Skills

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/simplify` | Reviews changed code for duplication, quality, efficiency — **then fixes it** |
| `/review` | Reviews code changes and reports issues — **read-only, no edits** |
| `/commit` | Runs `git add`, generates a commit message, and commits |
| `/test` | Detects the test framework, runs it, and analyzes failures |

All skills accept optional arguments:

```
/simplify focus on security
/review only check the API routes
/commit fix login page styling
/test only run test_auth.py
```

## Example

```
> /review

Running skill: /review…
↳ Bash(git diff) …  ✓ done

## Code Review Report
### Warning
- fib_recursive() does not handle negative input
### Suggestion
- Consider adding @functools.lru_cache

> /simplify

Running skill: /simplify…
↳ Read(fib.py) …    ✓ done
↳ Edit(fib.py) …    ✓ done
Fixed: added negative check, type annotations, lru_cache...
```

## Custom Skills

**Step 1**: Create a directory under `.code-flash/skills/`

```bash
mkdir -p .code-flash/skills/deploy
```

**Step 2**: Write a `SKILL.md` file

```markdown
---
name: deploy
description: Deploy to staging environment
---

# Deploy

1. Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
2. Run `./scripts/deploy.sh $ARGUMENTS`
3. Report deployment status
```

`$ARGUMENTS` is replaced with whatever you type after the command.

**Step 3**: Use it

```
> /deploy staging
Running skill: /deploy…
```
