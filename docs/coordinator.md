# Coordinator Mode

> This feature exists in the official Claude Code codebase but has not been fully released. code-flash implements and ships it.

Coordinator mode turns the assistant into an orchestrator that can launch background workers for parallel research, implementation, and verification.

## Usage

```bash
code-flash --coordinator
# or
export CODE_FLASH_COORDINATOR=1
code-flash
```

## What It Adds

- **Background workers** — launch a worker and keep talking while it runs
- **Continuation flow** — continue a completed worker with more instructions
- **Task notifications** — worker results injected back as `<task-notification>` messages
- **Session-aware resume** — resumed sessions restore coordinator mode automatically

## Worker Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Agent` | Spawn a background worker |
| `SendMessage` | Continue an existing worker by task ID |
| `TaskStop` | Stop a running worker |

## Typical Workflow

1. Start `code-flash --coordinator`
2. Ask for a larger task (research, implement, verify)
3. Coordinator launches workers in background
4. Worker results arrive as `<task-notification>` messages
5. Coordinator synthesizes results and decides next step

Workers use the standard tools: `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Bash`.
