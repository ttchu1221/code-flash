# KAIROS — Memory System

> This feature exists in the official Claude Code codebase but has not been fully released. code-flash implements and ships it.

The assistant can remember information across sessions and automatically consolidate memories over time.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/remember <text>` | Save a note to the daily log |
| `/memory` | Show current memory index |
| `/dream` | Manually consolidate daily logs into organized topic files |

## Auto-Dream

Runs automatically after a turn when:
- >= 24 hours since last consolidation
- >= 5 new sessions since last consolidation

Configurable: `--dream-interval`, `--dream-min-sessions`, `--no-auto-dream`

## Try It Out

```bash
code-flash --auto-approve
> /remember I prefer Python over JavaScript
> /remember Our project uses gRPC + PostgreSQL
> /dream                    # consolidate into topic files
> /memory                   # verify the index

# New session — the model recalls your preferences
code-flash
> What do you know about my preferences?
```

Data stored in `~/.config/code-flash/` (memory in `memory/`, sessions in `sessions/`).
